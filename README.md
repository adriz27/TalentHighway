# TalentHighway
Repository for the project done for the Mercedes-Benz AG Talent Highway Hackathon organized by TheCube.
The proposed challenge was to analyze the rise in the second-hand car market and propose a solution that would improve the positioning of the brand.
Our proposed solution was a classification of the cars by means of clustering algorithms based on their devaluation in the second-hand market. 
Once we obtained these clusters, we represented the information related to each of the groups through Power BI.
